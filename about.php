	<h1>Wejapa Internships</h1>
	<p>My profound gratitude goes to WeJapa for the great opportunity given to beginners like myself to actually learn, unlearn, relearn and expand our horizons in the tech world. Although, before the internship, I have taken time to learn the basics of web and android programming. Among others, I am comfortable with HTML5, CSS3, PHP, JAVASCRIPT, JAVA, and PYTHON (basic parts). I saw the advert about the Wejapa Intership on twitter and I decided to opt-in so as to further extend my learning. I opted in as a PHP-backend developer(beginner). The Intership took place for about 3-4 months of rigorous learning and hands-on tasks after each completed module.  At the end of the last module on the internship, we were assigned individual projects of creating a blog which gave birth to <a href="https://qozeemblog.herokuapp.com/index.php">qozeemblog.</a> I decided to launch the blog as it meets the standards of every other blogs out there that people get varieties of help from. <br> "I know learning can be exhausting, but he who never gives up shall see the light at the end of the tunnel." <i> <br> We Move.</i></p>
